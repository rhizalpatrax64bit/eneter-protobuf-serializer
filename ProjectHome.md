# Introduction #
The project integrates Eneter Messaging Framework with Protocol Buffer serialization enabling so the fast cross-platform communication using binary messages instead of XML or JSON.

## Downloads ##
  * [Eneter.ProtoBuf.Serializer 6.0.0](http://eneter.net/Downloads/Extensions/EneterProtoBufSerializer/EneterProtoBufSerializer600.zip) - source code and binaries of Eneter ProtoBufSerializer. The package also includes related protobuf and protobuf-net libraries.


## Quick Start ##
  * [Getting Started](https://code.google.com/p/eneter-protobuf-serializer/wiki/GettingStarted)

## Supported Platforms ##
Using Eneter ProtoBuf Serializer allows to implement the fast binary based communication between applications running on following platforms:
  * Java 6
  * Android 2.1 (or later)
  * .NET 3.5, .NET 4.0, .NET 4.5
  * Windows Phone 7.1
  * Compact Framework 2.0, Compact Framework 3.5
  * Silverlight 4, Silverlight 5
  * Mono 2.6.4

## Protocol Buffers ##
Protocol Buffers is the binary serializer originally developed by Google to share data among applications implemented in different languages Java, C++ and Python.
The biggest advantage of Protocol Buffers is its performance and availability on multiple platforms (it has been ported to .NET platforms too).
More details about Protocol Buffers can be found at https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/

## Eneter Messaging Framework ##
Eneter Messaging Framework is a middleware library developed to provide lightweight and easy to use communication across multiple platforms. It is free for non-commercial use.
